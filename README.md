# ReversiAI
### An attempt at recreating AlphaGo Zero algorithm for Reversi

AI for playing Reversi using Monte Carlo Tree Search with a neural network as a heuristic, trained by self-play. 

`reversi_trainer.py` trains a network. `reversi_tester.py` allows for running test games against random agent.

This project is quite messy at the moment, but it will be probably somewhat cleaned up and extended in the future.
